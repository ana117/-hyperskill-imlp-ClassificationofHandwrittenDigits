# Classification of Handwritten Digits
In this project, you are going to explore the main classification algorithms and learn how to find and train the best possible model for the classification of handwritten digits. You will need to process a dataset that includes images of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. The ultimate goal is to train the model to identify a digit on the picture. Sounds interesting? Let's dive into it!

Get hands-on experience with the Keras dataset, train a variety of classification algorithms, and find the best one using scikit-learn tools.

## Demo

## Stages
**Stage 1/5: The Keras dataset**\
Figure out how to load the dataset from the external resource, preprocess arrays, and provide general information about the data.

**Stage 2/5: Split into sets**\
Split the data into train and test sets and verify the class distribution.

**Stage 3/5: Train models with default settings**\
Explore sklearn classification algorithms, train the models, and compare the results.

**Stage 4/5: Data preprocessing**\
Normalize data, train the models, and explore if that improves the results.

**Stage 5/5: Hyperparameter tuning**\
Search through classifier parameter values and find a set of parameters that yields the best result.
